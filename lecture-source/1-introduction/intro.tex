% TODO: some notes on above
Differentiable Programming and Deep Learning give us the ability to computationally solve problems without needing to handcraft the solution or engineer the features. As long as we have data we can build and train models to make predictions.

\frametitle{What is Deep Learning?}

Deep learning is primarily characterised by function compositions: \\ \vspace{10mm}
\begin{itemize}
	\item<2-> Feedforward networks: $\bm{y} = f (g(\bm{x}; \bm\theta_g); \bm{\theta_f})$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Often with relatively simple functions (e.g. $f(\bm x; \bm{\theta}_f) = \sigma(\bm{x}^\top \bm{\theta}_f)$)
	\end{itemize} \vspace{3mm}
	\item<3-> Recurrent networks: $\bm y_t = f(\bm y_{t-1}, \bm x_t; \bm\theta) = f(f(\bm y_{t-2}, \bm x_{t-1}; \bm\theta), \bm x_t; \bm\theta) = \dots$
\end{itemize}
\vspace{10mm}

\end{frame}

In the early days the focus of deep learning was on learning functions for classification. Nowadays the functions are much more general in their inputs and outputs.

	\mode<presentation>{
	\item<+-> Captures the idea that computer programs can be partially learned rather than fully programmed by humans.
	\item<+-> The program is made of functions with optimisable parameters.
	}
	\mode<article>{\item<+-> Captures the idea that computer programs can be constructed of parameterised functional blocks in which the parameters are learned using some form of gradient-based optimisation.}
	% \begin{itemize}
		\item<+-> So we need to be able to compute gradients with respect to the parameters of these functional blocks.
		% \item<+-> The idea of Differentiable Programming also opens up interesting possibilities:
		% \begin{itemize}
			\item<+-> The functional blocks don't need to be direct functions in a mathematical sense; more generally they can be \emph{algorithms}.
			\item<+-> What if the functional block we're learning parameters for is itself an algorithm that optimises the parameters of an internal algorithm using a gradient based optimiser?!\footnote{See our ICLR 2019 paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03928 and NeurIPS 2019 paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06565}

\frametitle{Is all Deep Learning Differentiable Programming?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Not necessarily!
	\begin{itemize}
		\item<+-> Most deep learning systems are trained using first order gradient-based optimisers, but there is an active body of research on gradient-free methods.
		\item<+-> There is an increasing interest in methods that use different styles of learning, such as Hebbian learning, within deep networks. More broadly there are a number of us\footnote{including at least myself, my PhD students and Geoff Hinton!} who are interested in biologically motivated models and learning methods.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item<+-> There's a lot of recent research that computes biological proxies for gradients though!
		\end{itemize}

		\item<+-> This course will primarily focus on differentiable methods, but we'll look at how relaxations can be made to make non-differentiable operators learnable with gradient-based optimisers.

\end{frame}

Language translation has made massive leaps over the last 10 years as a result of deep learning. Initially this was because of large aligned datasets and translation models that targeted transforming a sequence of words in one language to another. As a result of large language models we are increasingly seeing translation quality improve in terms of the nuance and subjective feel of the translation --- translations are starting to becoming more natural and less mechanistic (but possibly less objectively accurate as a result).

The above picture shows how model performance has been shown to be linked to the amount of data. The story of the last 10-15 years has been one of increasingly growing data. Traditional approaches to machine learning have largely not scaled in performance in the same way large deep neural networks have. This is predominantly because of the way features are extracted from the data; traditional machine learning often used hand-crafted features, whereas the story of deep learning is all about feature learning --- giving the model essentially raw data and letting it learn to appropriate features to make decisions from. 

We should recognise however that traditional methods still have their place - when datasets are small, and perhaps there isn't much feature engineering to do, they can and do outperform deeper models. At the same time, a large proportion of deep network architectures are themselves nothing more than a learned linear model (linear regression, logistic regression, SVM, ...) attached to a learned feature extractor, so those very basic traditional methods are still very much a big part of the picture today!
